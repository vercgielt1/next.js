Welcome to the Next.js documentation!

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework that enables you to build high-quality applications with React components.

As a framework, Next.js handles the tooling and configuration needed to build with React, and provides additional features and optimizations.

You can use React to build your UI, and incrementally adopt Next.js features to solve common application requirements such as routing, data fetching, and caching - all while improving the developer and end-user experience.

Whether you're an individual developer or part of a large team, Next.js can help you build interactive, dynamic, and performant applications.

## Pre-Requisite knowledge

To get started with Next.js, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and [React](https://react.dev/).

If you're new to React, we recommend the [React Foundations Course](/learn/react-foundations) which will walk you through the main principles. Afterwards, you can learn Next.js by [building a dashboard application](/learn/dashboard-app) or walking through the **Getting Started** section (you are here) of these docs.

## How to use the docs

### App and pages router switcher

Next.js includes two routers: the [App Router](/docs/app) and the [Pages Router](/docs/pages). The App Router supports newer React features like Server Components and Streaming. The Pages Router is the original Next.js router, still supported for existing projects.

You can switch between these routers using the dropdown menu in the sidebar. The breadcrumbs at the top of each page will also show which router you're viewing.

### Search

You can search the docs using the search bar at the top or with the shortcut (`Ctrl + K` or `Cmd + K`).

### Navigation

The docs are organized into three main sections: **Getting Started** (you are here), [**Examples**](/docs/app/building-your-application), and [**API Reference**](/docs/app/api-reference). You can navigate between these sections using the sidebar.

### Accessibility

For the best experience with screen readers, we recommend using Firefox with [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/about-nvda/) or Safari with [VoiceOver](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/voiceover/welcome/mac).
